## My GitHub Projects

You can find all of my GitHub projects below. I arranged them in release order so it's more easy to track.

- [Harvesting With Newton](https://github.com/ufukozdogan/harvestingwithnewton): Simple React.js Game with some apples and a cute tree! Upon clicking the button tree starts to shake.

- [Smart House](https://github.com/ufukozdogan/akilli-evim): Made by using Arduino, couple of sensors and Java environment.

- [Quiz Game](https://github.com/ufukozdogan/java-swing-quizgame): Amateur work made by Java Swing

- [Find-S Algorithm](https://github.com/ufukozdogan/find-s): Implementation of Find-S AI Algorithm. Values are editable in real time thus makes the application data user manageable.

This section is destined to get rich.
